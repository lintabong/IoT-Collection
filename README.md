# IoT-Collection

A collection of arduino codes and similar boards (Raspberry pi & ESP8266) derived from my various experiments. You can use the code for free.


### 1. [Waterflow Meter (NodeMCU - Firebase - Android Native)](https://github.com/lintabong/Water-Flow-Monitoring)
<p>Using nodeMCU, I created a circuit to read the waterflow and transmit the data to the Firebase Realtime Database. Then, the data that has been sent in firebase, downloaded and monitored in real time using android app.</p>

### 2. [MQ7 Realtime Sensor & Datalogger](https://github.com/lintabong/MQ7-Datalogger)
<p>I have created a datalogger to detect co levels in percent by using MQ7. As well as a program to calculate how long the program runs without using RTC, co-level data is stored into a sd card.</p>

### 3. [Car Counter](https://github.com/lintabong/IoT-Collection/tree/main/CarCounter)
<p>Car Counter Based on distance sensor, first we count initial time of of car and then measure the end time with second distance sensor</p>
